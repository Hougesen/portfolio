# portfolio

Portfolio with Github integration to fetch pinned repositories.

Currently using this as my own portfolio, which can be seen at [mhouge.dk](https://mhouge.dk).

Feel free to use it as a template if you wish.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
